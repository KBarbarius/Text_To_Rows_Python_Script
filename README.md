# Text_To_Rows_Python_Script
I have created a python script that you can use to convert text to Rows specifically when text is separated by by commas. See the script and its output.

Noted: you will need to change the input file path in line 5. Also change your columns names in line 10,15,16 and 18

After these changes are made you are good to go.

I have also attached how the data will look before and after.
